# kMeansAlgorithm :floppy_disk:

    Given: 
    
    * Dataset(data.csv)containing 600 vectors, named V1, V2...,V600. Each vector has dimension (size) of 3. 
    
    * Dataset also contains the initial cluster centers(3 clusters)named C1,C2 and C3 (also of size 3)after the rows containing the vectors. 
    
    * Implement the k-means algorithm with the given vectors and initial cluster centers and plot results after clustering.
