# k-Means Algorithm :floppy_disk:

##### Given: 
    
* Dataset(data.csv)containing 600 vectors, named V1, V2...,V600. Each vector has dimension (size) of 3. 
    
* Dataset also contains the initial cluster centers(3 clusters)named C1,C2 and C3 (also of size 3)after the rows containing the vectors. 
    
##### Implement:

* k-means algorithm with the given vectors and initial cluster centers and plot results after clustering.
